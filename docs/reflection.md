# 🧠 Reflection & Modern C++

## 📚 Learning Journey

Creating the Digital Rain effect has deepened my understanding of real-time rendering, console programming, and the principles of modern C++.

## 🧰 Modern C++ Practices Used

- **Object-Oriented Design**: Classes like `DigitalRain` and `CharacterStream` encapsulate logic and allow for reuse and modular design.
- **Standard Library Containers**: Used `std::vector` and `std::list` to manage dynamic character streams and enable efficient insert/delete.
- **Scoped Initialization**: Used `{}` initialization, `auto`, and RAII principles.
- **Randomization & Seeding**: Used `srand(static_cast<unsigned int>(time(nullptr)))` to ensure randomness across runs.

## 💬 What I Learned

- Efficient rendering without flickering requires precise cursor control and selective redrawing.
- Managing lifecycles of visual elements (drops) introduces game loop logic in a console app.
- MkDocs is a powerful tool for documenting C++ projects and aligns well with GitHub Pages deployment.

## 🔮 Future Iteration

- Use `std::chrono` and C++20 coroutines for smoother frame management.
- Integrate user interactivity (pause, speed control).
- Explore Unicode support for more authentic glyphs.
